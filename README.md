# Workshop on DSEMs in Stan
This repository contains R code to implement Standard and DYNASTI Dynamic Structural Equation Models in Stan. The workshop is created by Jessica Schaaf and Michael Aristodemou.
The first module *Intro to DSEM* contains background information on DSEMs with beautiful pictures created by Michael Aristodemou.
The second module *Get started* guides one through the basic requirements (software, packages, etc.).
The third module *Implementing models in Stan* provides some background on implementing Stan models. 
A similar tutorial on DSEMs in Stan but more focused on implementing and adjusting models yourself can be found here: https://github.com/mearistodemou/DSEM_workshop/tree/main.

From the fourth module onwards, the modules contain exercises guiding one through the step-by-step process of analyzing data with DSEMs in Stan.
These steps include fitting a standard DSEM and interpreting population-level effects (*Fitting a simple DSEM*), diving into individual differences (*Investigating individual differences*), how to add covariates (*Adding covariates*), fitting asymmetric (DYNASTI) versions of a DSEM (*Fitting a DYNASTI DSEM*), and how to add predictors of DSEM parameters (*Predictors of DSEM parameters*).
