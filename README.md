# Workshop on DSEMs in Stan
This repository contains R code to implement Standard and DYNASTI Dynamic Structural Equation Models in Stan. The workshop is created by Jessica Schaaf and Michael Aristodemou.

The first module *Intro to DSEM* contains background information on DSEMs with beautiful pictures created by Michael Aristodemou.

The second module *Get started* guides one through the basic requirements (software, packages, etc.).

The third module *Implementing models in Stan* provides some background on implementing Stan models. 
A similar tutorial on DSEMs in Stan but more focused on implementing and adjusting models yourself can be found [here](https://github.com/mearistodemou/DSEM_workshop/tree/main).

From the fourth module onwards, the modules contain exercises guiding one through the step-by-step process of analyzing data with DSEMs in Stan.
These steps include fitting a standard DSEM and interpreting population-level effects (*Fitting a simple DSEM*), diving into individual differences (*Investigating individual differences*), how to add covariates (*Adding covariates*), fitting asymmetric (DYNASTI) versions of a DSEM (*Fitting a DYNASTI DSEM*), and how to add predictors of DSEM parameters (*Predictors of DSEM parameters*).

**How to get started**

First download and open the *dsem-workshop.html* file. This will give you a formatted online version of the workshop. In the upper right corner there should be a button with 'Code', make sure to select the option 'Hide all code'. You now don't see our coding which allows you to think about how to code things yourself first. If you run into trouble, you can click 'Code' next to assignments to reveal our code. Speaking of coding, also download the *dsem-workshop-assignment.Rmd* file and open it in R. This is the same file but without R code. If you open these two files (the online assignment and the emptied Rmarkdown file), you're good to go.

Have fun! If you have any questions or complications, you may contact Jessica on jessica.schaaf@radboudumc.nl.
